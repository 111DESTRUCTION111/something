This simple but effective program is designed to convert the average city's temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius. It takes in a text file with a list of cities and their associated temperatures in Fahrenheit, and returns another text file with the cities and their temperatures in Celsius. This program is very lightweight, being only 26 lines long, and only 673 bytes. Even an antique machine could run this with the right compiler. That being said, it can read and interpret any dataset of any size. Theoretically, you could convert thousands of city temperatures at a time.


The current iteration of this code does not have any comments, which makes it harder for the layman to understand. Additionally, I think it could be simplified further, and some redundant features, such as the <vector> library reference, could be removed. If I were to revise this, I would add comments and remove redundant sections. That being said, the variable names and overall structure are about as good as they can be, and I'd imagine that this program could be modified to suit a wide variety of tasks.


The most challenging part of this project was reading from and writing to external files. Previously, all of the coding that I have done only ever read from specific files that I edited directly. Getting the code read and write automatically was a new experience for me.&nbsp;The ability to make code that can read from and write to files is a very useful, much more so than simple console-based programs. I have already used this knowledge in another project of mine, greatly simplifying an otherwise tedious procedure.
